# Former services

To help understand historical references, here are brief descriptions and mentions of former services that have since been decommissioned or otherwise no longer managed by the jQuery Team.

| When | What | Domains | Description | Decom ticket
|--|--|--|--|--
| 2017 | **Mocha Builder** | - | Created in 2017. Never used. Decommissioned in 2021. Host: `mocha-01.ops.jquery.net` | -
| 2017 | **Mocha Jenkins** | <http://mochajs.jenkins.jquery.com> | Provisioned in 2017 [0abf9e6ad2](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/0abf9e6ad2c65b8560c87ea345070a009e7bd654), [2f04981a22](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/2f04981a22149a0991c4b00d598b5f292f13f8e7). Decommissioned in 2021. Host: `jenkins-02.ops.jquery.net` | -
| 2020 | **jQuery Mobile Download Builder** | https://amd-builder.jquerymobile.com | This is a Node.js service that used to be hosted on dedicated servers that we manage. It is considered an internal domain. It is embedded in the public-facing web page at https://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/. These services are now provisioned by a Docker image, and automatically created and deployed as DigitalOcean App instead. Source code: <https://github.com/jquery/node-amd-builder> Prior to 2020, it was part of the `builder` role in Puppet and hosted on the builder-01.ops.jquery.net server. | -
| 2020 | **jQuery UI services** | https://download.jqueryui.com/ | The jQuery UI Download Builder and jQuery UI ThemeRoller are Node.js services that used to be hosted on dedicated VM servers that we managed. Prior to 2020, these Node.js services ran on `builder-01.ops.jquery.net` alongside the WordPress builder and jQuery Mobile services. They are now provisioned by a Docker image, and run as DigitalOcean App that is automatically created and deployed after each commit. This domain is generally not browsed directly (it a non-user facing plaintext index as such). Instead, it is used in an integrated manner via the website at <https://jqueryui.com/download/> at <https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/>. Source code: <https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com>, <https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui-themeroller>. | -
| 2021 | **Gitview** | ~~<https://view.jqueryui.com>~~, ~~<https://view.jquery.com>~~, ~~<https://view.jquerymobile.com>~~, ~~<https://view.css-chassis.com>~~ | Gitview instances for jQuery projects were located on the same servers as **jQuery Mobile services**, and actually predate jQuery Mobile services (which is where the view-01 server name comes from). These were decomissioned in 2021 and replaced by redirects on miscweb. | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/49
| 2021 | **jQuery IRC Archive** | https://irc.jquery.org/ | This was a WordPress site hosted on wp-01.ops.jquery.net with the IRC archive subdirectory internally proxied to a static file server running on `znc.ops.jquery.net`. As of 2021, this is now a static website. Source code: <https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org/>. | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/48
| 2021 | **jQuery ZNC** | http://irc.jquery.org/ | `znc.ops.jquery.net` | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/48
| 2023 | **CLA Server** | - | `cla-02.ops.jquery.net` | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/12
| - | **jQuery Jenkins** | https://jenkins.jquery.com, http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com | This is used by jQuery Projects to react to commits on GitHub main branches, to submit jobs to TestSwarm, to generate a build and rsync pre-release artefacts to filestash (serves part of releases.jquery.com), and to temporarily host a copy of the project repo at this commit under <http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com> for TestSwarm/BrowserStack clients to access. Host: `jenkins-01.ops.jquery.net` | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/47
| - | **TestSwarm** | https://swarm.jquery.org/ | PHP+MySQL web app (<https://github.com/jquery/testswarm>) that receives jobs from Jenkins for jQuery Projects (jQuery Core, jQuery UI, jQuery Color, QUnit). The tests are then run in BrowserStack by the testswarm-browserstack Node.js deamon <https://github.com/jquery/testswarm-browserstack>. Host: `swarm-02.ops.jquery.net` | https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/47
